# SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS

The applications listed below in alphabetical order are free or demonstration versions of applications that support the C3D format and provide access to C3D files. The majority of applications are written for a Windows PC but some items include support for LabVIEW and MATLAB as well as C, C++ and Visual Basic applications.

The C3D.ORG web site welcomes submissions of any user-written or commercial C3D programs for inclusion on these pages.  Please e-mail [info@c3d.org](mailto:info@c3d.org) for details or information about submitting applications to this list. A list of manufacturers supporting the C3D formal can be found [here](/manufacturers).

Updated for 32/64-bit Windows systems, this provides easy-to-use C3D file access from Visual Basic, MATLAB, C++, Excel, Java, and Word etc. The SDK includes documentation, sample Visual Basic and C++ code, and a C3D file editing application (including Visual Basic source code and documentation).

**[C3D FILE VIEWER (MLSVIEWER)](https://c3d.org/apps/MLSviewer_setup.exe)**
A fully functional C3D file viewer written by Motion Lab Systems that runs on any Windows computer.  It allows the user to view the parameter structure, analog data values and 3D data values stored in any C3D file up 32,767 frames long without any risk of modifying or changing the contents of the C3D file in any way.

**[PYC3DSERVER - USER WRITTEN](https://pypi.org/project/pyc3dserver/)**
PyC3Dserver is a user-written Python interface for the 64-bit [C3Dserver](https://c3d.org/apps/C3Dserver_setup.exe) allowing Python applications to read and access C3D files. PyC3Dserver is distributed under the MIT license. Users can install PyC3Dserver module from the [PyPI website](https://pypi.org/project/pyc3dserver/), the PyC3Dserver source code is open in its [GitHub](https://github.com/mkjung99/pyc3dserver) page.

**[EZC3D, A C3D FILE ACCESS SUITE](https://github.com/pyomeca/ezc3d)**
Currently under active development, EZC3D is a open source C++/Matlab/Python solution available on github.com for reading and writing C3D files that the authors claim can be used to read and modify C3D files from Vicon, Qualisys and Optotrak systems and generate C3D files.

**[LABVIEW C3D FILE ACCESS - USER WRITTEN](https://c3d.org/apps/c3d_reader_labview_b.zip)**
This is a collection of LabVIEW .vi files that enables LabVIEW to export the header, parameters and data from a C3D file to ASCII. It runs under LabVIEW on both PC and Mac platforms and was developed at the [School of Physiotherapy at Curtin University](http://physiotherapy.curtin.edu.au/) in Australia.

**[MATLAB ACCESS - USER WRITTEN](https://c3d.org/apps/c3d_matlab.zip)**
This is a collection of user-written m-files that enables full functionality of the Motion Lab Systems [C3Dserver](https://c3d.org/apps/C3Dserver_setup.exe) within the MathWorks MATLAB environment.

**[A MATLAB TOOLBOX - USER WRITTEN](https://c3d.org/apps/GaitExtractToolbox16.zip)**
