This collection of C3D files is a resource for programmers, developers, and users who want to test their software applications for compatibility with the C3D standard and different manufacturers files for data exchange compatibility. Each downloadable zip file contains a text file with additional information about the C3D file contents. This collection has been updated to organize the file collection by functionality while retaining the original ZIP file names for compatibility.

All software applications that claim C3D compatibility should be able to open and read the sample files that meet both the original and current C3D specifications as well as handle C3D files that contain errors in a sensible manner.

## CURRENT C3D EXAMPLES

This file contains a collection of sample C3D files submitted by various manufacturers to C3D.ORG for the web site upgrade in 2019 to demonstrate each companies current implementation of the C3D file format. Some files may include parameters that do not fully meet the C3D standard, for example incorrect analog scale parameters.

## TEST SUITES

Each of the test suites contains a collection of C3D files, each containing identical data and parameters in the three C3D formats variants (DEC, Intel, and SGI/MIPS formats) written as floating-point and integer data types.  These files can be used to check that an application reads all of the C3D file types correctly.  Each file has been generated from the same original data. The C3D compatibility test suite contains files with varying parameter and data block locations an is designed to demonstrate that C3D applications read the parameter and data block locations correctly.

### <img src="img/C3DIconv3.png" width="30"/>[SAMPLE01 - C3D FILE TEST SUITE](/data/Sample01.zip)
- This is a unique set of six C3D files created using ADTech AMASS software on a DEC PDP11 running the RSX11-M operating system in 1989. Each of the six files contain identical data and parameters in each of the C3D formats variants (DEC, Intel, and SGI/MIPS endian formats) in both floating-point and integer data types. These files can be used to verify that software applications read all of the six C3D file format variations correctly as all six files contain identical data values. A spreadsheet is included that documents the calculation of the POINT:SCALE factor for C3D files.
### <img src="img/C3DIconv3.png" width="30"/>[SAMPLE02 - C3D FILES FOR DATA FORMAT TESTING](/data/Sample02.zip)
- A set of six C3D files containing data stored as integer and floating-point values in Intel, SGI and DEC endian formats. The files were created using AMASS with Vicon 370 hardware - each file contains identical data, parameters, and header events stored in each of the six basic C3D formats variants and can be used to verify that software applications read the individual C3D formats correctly.
### <img src="img/C3DIconv3.png" width="30"/>[SAMPLE08 - C3D COMPATIBILITY TEST SUITE](/data/Sample08.zip)
- A set of C3D test files in Intel integer format data generated by Motion Lab Systems. These files can be used to check that C3D compatible applications read the correct pointer values from the C3D header in block 1 of the C3D file. All files contain identical 3D and parameter data but place the parameter and 3D data sections in different locations.
### <img src="img/C3DIconv3.png" width="30"/>[SAMPLE36 - C3D POINT:FRAMES TEST SUITE](/data/Sample36.zip)
- A set of C3D files generated by Motion Lab Systems that can be used to test software applications abilities to read different sized C3D files (18,124, 36,220 and 72,610 frames). These files demonstrate that the parameter POINT:FRAMES can be stored as either an integer, or a floating point value, when software applications read the C3D parameter section correctly.

## SAMPLE C3D DATA

These C3D files demonstrates the C3D parameter structure and recorded data values from various manufacturers and data collection environments.

### <img src="img/C3DIconv3.png" width="30"/>[SAMPLE07 - 16-BIT ANALOG DATA](/data/Sample07.zip)
- A sample C3D file that contains 16-bit analog data - note the values for the parameter ANALOG:OFFSET. The data is stored in PC floating point format as directly sampled values which enables the user to review the data collection performance and correct any configuration errors after the data collection as taken place. Unfortunately the file does not contain any valid 3D data points or significant analog data values. Many manufacturers have abandoned this method with the result that any data sampling or scaling errors in the floating point samples are hard to diagnose.
### <img src="img/C3DIconv3.png" width="30"/>[SAMPLE10 - TYPE-2, TYPE-3, AND TYPE-4 FORCE PLATE DATA](/data/Sample10.zip)
- Two C3D files containing identical force plate TYPE-2 and TYPE-4 data, one is configured to describe the data as a TYPE-2 plate using the major diagonal components of the force plate sensitivity matrix while the second file describes the force plate as a TYPE-4 plate using the entire sensitivity matrix.

- Two files - bodybuilder.c3d is a large C3D file generated using Vicon "370" software, in DEC floating-point format. The second file, sub_labels.c3d, uses parameters to identify two subjects for the 3D point data. This is stored in DEC integer format and some of the calculated POINT variables show a loss of resolution as the data values approach the POINT:SCALE value.
### <img src="img/C3DIconv3.png" width="30"/>[SAMPLE05 - C3D FILE WITH FORCE AND EMG DATA](/data/Sample05.zip)

### <img src="img/C3DIconv3.png" width="30"/>[SAMPLE33 - A STATIC TEST C3D FILE](/data/Sample33.zip)
- A static test C3D file with a large parameter block. The original C3D standard permitted the DATA_START value (pointing to the start of the 3D data block) to be a signed integer (values +1 to +127) thus the maximum DATA_START value expected by many applications is +127. This C3D file has a DATA_START value of 188 which exceeds the signed limit of +127. It may crash older applications that interpret the DATA_START parameter as signed, instead of unsigned.

## FORMATTING ISSUES

These C3D files illustrate common formatting issues that may be encountered when opening C3D files from a wide range of sources. These may be due to many different reasons - incorrect assumptions by the data collection or file creation software, potentially hardware errors during data collection, or configuration error in the data collection environment when the system was installed.

### <img src="img/C3DIconv3.png" width="30"/>[SAMPLE14 - DATA SYNCHRONIZATION ERRORS](/data/Sample14.zip)
- A single C3D file containing 3D and analog data illustrating a loss of 3D data and analog data synchronization which can be clearly seen when looking at the force plate Fz data.
### <img src="img/C3DIconv3.png" width="30"/>[SAMPLE15 - MISSING PARAMETERS](/data/Sample15.zip)
- Two C3D files from a force plate vector test but which do not contain the ANALOG:FORCE_PLATFORM group rendering the test meaningless.

- Three sample C3D files that have all their 3D residuals set to -1 indicating that the data points are invalid. As a result most C3D applications will report that these files do not contain any data points.
### <img src="img/C3DIconv3.png" width="30"/>[SAMPLE18 - CORRUPT PARAMETER SECTION](/data/Sample18.zip)
- A C3D file with corrupt parameter section and may cause some applications to crash when reading the parameters.
### <img src="img/C3DIconv3.png" width="30"/>[SAMPLE20 - MISSING PARAMETERS](/data/Sample20.zip)

### <img src="img/C3DIconv3.png" width="30"/>[SAMPLE21 - MISSING PARAMETERS](/data/Sample21.zip)
- A C3D file with data that does not match the parameters recorded in the file - as a result the data will be read incorrectly. The actual 3D data frame rate is 200 and the analog sample rate is 1000Hz but the parameters claim incorrectly that the POINT:RATE is 60 and the ANALOG:RATE is 1020.
### <img src="img/C3DIconv3.png" width="30"/>[SAMPLE24 - EMPTY PARAMETERS](/data/Sample24.zip)
- A C3D file with blank data labels which will cause most C3D applications to fail as there is no way to distinguish one 3D point from another.

- A C3D file that illustrates a data corruption problem caused by importing data from a USB based system, while independently sampling data from other sources. The user thought the EMG data was noisy but spectrum analysis shows that the data import process had corrupted the EMG data.
