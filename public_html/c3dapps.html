		<h2>Software Applications</h2>
		<p>The applications listed below in alphabetical order are free or demonstration versions of  applications that support the C3D format and provide access to C3D files. The majority of applications are written for a Windows PC but some items include support for LabVIEW and MATLAB as well as C, C++ and Visual Basic applications.</p>
		<p>The C3D.ORG web site welcomes submissions of any user-written or commercial C3D programs for inclusion on these pages.  Please e-mail <a href="mailto:info@c3d.org">info@c3d.org</a> for details or information about submitting applications to this list. A list of manufacturers supporting the C3D formal can be found <a href="../c3dsupport.html">here</a>.</p>
