      <h4><a href="docs/C3D_User_Guide.pdf">C3D User Guide - PDF</a></h4>
      <p>This is the current  release of the C3D User Guide which documents the C3D format in detail so that everyone can understand the details of the format and potentially write software to access or create C3D files. It is recommended that anyone working with C3D files reads this manual to understand the contents and structure of the C3D format.</p>

      <h4><a href="docs/C3D_User_Guide.chm">C3D HELP FILE</a></h4>
      <p>This is compiled help (.CHM) version of the C3D User Guide that is generated from the same documents as the  PDF  C3D User Guide. It can be downloaded and distributed with any application that supports  C3D files. Note that when the file is downloaded, you may need to set the file  properties to unblock access before the help file contents can be displayed.</p>

      <h4><a href="docs/c3d_scale.xlsx">Calculating Analog Scale Parameters</a></h4>
      <p>An open XML spreadsheet written by Motion Lab Systems that calculates the  C3D Analog Scale parameters for AMTI (TYPE2 and TYPE-4) force plates, Kistler (TYPE-3) force plates, Load Cells, and other analog signal sources.  The spreadsheet supports all   ADC resolutions and input voltage ranges, and enables the user to investigate and calculate C3D scale factors while  documenting the mathematics.

      <h4><a href="docs/C3D.pdf">Original  C3D specification</a></h4>
      <p>This is a PDF version of the original  text file that documented the C3D file format as written by  Andrew Dainis for the AMASS software package, released in the mid 1980's.  This software description has largely been superceded by the C3D Technical User manual which should be used as a reference for all new applications. This document is included for historical reference purposes.</p>

These can be associated with the biomechanics C3D file type when the application is installed to provide all users with a common visual environment.</p>

      <p>The 2008 revision of the C3D User Guide  was the last version that  included descriptions  of  some variables used in gait analysis, and stored in a C3D file by manipulating  the 3D marker location format. This is a storage method that uses the C3D format, but is not part of the  C3D format definition.</p>
