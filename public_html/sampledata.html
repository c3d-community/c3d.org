		<p>This collection of C3D files is a resource for programmers, developers, and users who want to test their software applications for compatibility with the C3D standard and different manufacturers files for data exchange compatibility. Each downloadable zip file contains a text file with additional information about the C3D file contents. This collection has been updated to organize the file collection by functionality while retaining the original ZIP file names for compatibility.</p>
		<p>All software applications that claim C3D compatibility should be able to open and read the sample files that meet both the original and current C3D specifications as well as handle C3D files that contain errors in a sensible manner.</p>

			<p>This file  contains a collection of sample C3D files submitted by various manufacturers to C3D.ORG for the web site upgrade in 2019 to demonstrate each companies current implementation of the C3D file format. Some files may include parameters that do not fully meet the C3D standard, for example incorrect analog scale parameters.</p>

			<p>Each of the test suites contains a collection of C3D files, each containing identical data and parameters in  the three C3D formats variants (DEC, Intel, and SGI/MIPS formats) written as floating-point  and integer data types.  These files can be used to check that an application reads all of the C3D file types correctly.  Each file has been generated from the same original data. The C3D compatibility test suite contains files with varying parameter and data block locations an is designed to demonstrate that C3D applications read the parameter and data block locations correctly.</p>
			<h4><a href="data/Sample01.zip"><img src="images/C3D.png" width="20" height="20" alt="C3D file"> Sample01 - C3D file  Test SUITE</a></h4>
			<ul>
			  <li>This is a unique set of six C3D files  created using ADTech AMASS software on a DEC PDP11 running the RSX11-M operating system in 1989.  Each of the six files contain identical data and parameters in each of the C3D formats variants (DEC, Intel, and SGI/MIPS endian formats) in both floating-point  and integer  data types. These files can be used to verify that software applications read all of the six  C3D file format variations correctly as all six files contain identical data values. A spreadsheet is included that documents the calculation of the POINT:SCALE factor for C3D files.</li>

			<ul>
			  <li>A set of six C3D files containing data stored as integer and floating-point values in Intel, SGI and DEC endian formats. The files were created using AMASS with Vicon 370 hardware - each file contains identical data, parameters, and header events stored in each of the six basic C3D formats variants and can be used to verify that software applications read the individual C3D formats correctly.</li>

The data is stored in PC floating point format as directly sampled values which enables the user to review the data collection performance and correct any configuration errors after the data collection as taken place. Unfortunately the file does not contain any valid 3D data points or significant analog data values.  Many manufacturers have abandoned this method with the result that any data sampling or scaling errors in the floating point samples are hard to diagnose.</li>
