<h1>Preface</h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In May 2002, Andrew Dainis wrote the following brief 
summary of the history of the C3D format for inclusion in this user guide …</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>During 1986 and 1987, Douglas McGuire, and I undertook 
the task of developing a suite of commercial software programs to facilitate the 
generation of accurate three-dimensional (3D) data from video camera measurement 
systems.  The result of this effort was AMASS (ADTECH Motion Analysis 
Software System) which included components for camera linearization, system 
calibration, automatic marker tracking at the 3D level, 3D marker 
identification, and a graphics program (ADG) to display the final results which 
were in the format of C3D files.  I must thank the Biomechanics Laboratory 
at the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, Maryland), and in particular, 
Lynn Gerber and Steven Stanhope, for providing encouragement and support through 
of laboratory facilities that enabled the project to be completed.</i></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>Shortly after its completion AMASS was licensed to 
Oxford Metrics Ltd.  (Oxford, England), and sold independently to a number 
of biomechanics laboratories.  The subsequent introduction and success of 
the VAX/VMS based Vicon-VX system by Oxford Metrics resulted in the widespread 
use of AMASS and C3D files within the biomechanics community</i></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i>In the past, several factors have contributed to prevent 
a still wider acceptance of the C3D file format.  The first was the lack of 
thorough and complete documentation of the file structure and parameter contents 
by the AMASS manuals.  The second, partially resulting from the first, was 
an insufficient understanding by programmers of the capabilities and flexibility 
of the file structure.  This lack of understanding resulted in some 
attempts to put “round pegs into square holes”, and generated a legacy of C3D 
files and applications that digressed from the original format and 
intention.  Many of these files and their applications are still around 
today and cause considerable problems for programmers who wish to handle every 
C3D file.  A third factor was that a formal standard for the format was 
never established or universally agreed upon, resulting in uncertainties for 
programmers trying to implement it.  In my estimation, this manual should 
go a long way towards belatedly overcoming all of these shortcomings.</i></p><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="welcometothec3dfileformat.htm" id="welcometothec3dfileformat.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">Welcome to the C3D File Format</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The C3D file format is the standard data exchange and 
archival storage file format in the 3D motion capture and biomechanics 
industries, designed to allow users to create files that contain 3D location and 
analog sensor information that can be read by any application or any data 
processing system. The file format has been in use since 1987 and was placed in 
the public domain to promote easy access and the exchange of clinical gait, 
biomechanics, animation, and other motion capture collection events.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The C3D file format may be used by anyone without 
requesting permission and without payment of any license fee.  This 
document exists to provide all the information needed to access data stored a 
C3D file and understand the concepts that define the format; both as it was 
originally created and the changes that have been introduced to the C3D format 
to accommodate modern technology and the data collection environments that have 
evolved since the creation of the format.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This user guide contains complete details of the public 
domain specification of the C3D file format and is intended to provide all the 
information necessary to allow anyone to support standard C3D files in any 
software application, as well as biomechanics, engineering or other data 
collection environments that use C3D files.  It attempts to provide all the 
necessary technical documentation for:</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 180.0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Wingdings"> </span>Application and system programmers who 
write software applications that create or access C3D files containing <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103560" href="gloss_3dpoint.htm">3D point</a> and analog information.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 180.0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Wingdings"> </span>Users who need to configure or set up 
motion capture data collection environments that use the C3D format to store 
data.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 180.0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Wingdings"> </span>Users who want to understand how their 
data is stored, access it themselves and if needed, edit, revise, and update 
their data.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 180.0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Wingdings"> </span>Any company or individual who wants to 
create applications that support the creation of C3D files for storing 3D and 
analog data, exporting C3D files to other formats, and accessing of data in the 
C3D format.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">While the user guide occasionally assumes that the reader 
is comfortable with the concepts of hexadecimal notation, binary formats, simple 
mathematics, and basic programming structures, it is not necessary to be an 
expert in order to use this documentation.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The aim is to document and explain the C3D format so that 
anyone accessing or creating C3D files can understand the format and update 
their file contents without causing any loss of data or problems for other 
users, while maintaining complete data access for all users.  It is 
recommended that anyone working with C3D data, creating or editing C3D files, 
reads this user guide because it defines the C3D file format.</p><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="acknowledgements1.htm" id="acknowledgements1.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">Acknowledgements</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt">The family of file formats, of 
which the C3D file is a major component, were first developed by Andrew Dainis 
for the AMASS (<a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103561" href="adtech.htm">ADTECH</a> Motion Analysis Software System) 3D photogrammetry 
software created in the early 1980’s.  It would not have been possible to 
write this user guide without his assistance, and the cooperation of many C3D 
users who have provided sample data and have answered questions over the years. 
 I should also like to thank Craig Smith, who was the first person (outside 
ADTECH and the NIH) to visualize the potential of the C3D format for the 3D 
motion capture industry and lobby Julian Morris at Oxford Metrics, Ltd., to 
adopt AMASS, resulting in the C3D format becoming the standard for <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103562" href="gloss_3ddata.htm">3D data</a> exchange.  Special thanks are also due 
to Steven Stanhope for his support of numerous C3D users around the world over a 
great many years, as well as his persistence and efforts to develop a universal, 
reliable, motion capture environment.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Particular thanks are due to Andrew Dainis who gave 
permission to refer to, and quote from, the AMASS User and Reference Manuals, 
and has answered many questions about the details of the format, clarifying many 
of the internal details and the history of the development of the C3D 
specification.  Without his help and encouragement, this user guide would 
not exist.</p><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="disclaimer1.htm" id="disclaimer1.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">Disclaimer</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The first release of this documentation was created in 2001 
as a result of requests during the C3D User Group discussions sponsored by 
Motion Lab Systems Inc., at the annual Gait and Clinical Motion Analysis Society 
(GCMAS) meeting in Sacramento, California.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">After the meeting I volunteered to document the C3D file 
format because I had been working with C3D files for many years as part of my 
previous employment.  Initially installing, supporting, and training Oxford 
Metrics Vicon systems clinical and research users worldwide to use the Vicon 
native data collection software on DEC RSX-11M computer systems.  Then, 
after Oxford Metrics adopted the AMASS system, assisting the transition of users 
to the AMASS software with the C3D format on the RSX-11M Vicon systems, and 
finally to install and use the Windows 3.1 based Vicon 370 systems for <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103564" href="gloss_3ddata.htm">3D data</a> collection and processing in a C3D 
environment.  During this period also worked with H.K. Ramakrishnan, 
assisting his rewriting the Helen Hayes Hospital Clinical Software system to 
move the Helen Hayes Software from the original DEC RSX-11M based file formats 
to the C3D format, and worked with Oxford Metrics Ltd develop the Vicon Clinical 
Manager software to reproduce the clinical results generated by the Helen Hayes 
Software.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This user guide has its origins in conversations and emails 
over many years working to support end-users and help programmers write software 
that creates and accesses files that use the C3D file format.  I have been 
working with the C3D file format since 1987, installing the AMASS photogrammetry 
software on Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11 computers with the RSX-11M 
operating system for Oxford Metrics Ltd and supporting their users.  I was 
present at the breakfast meeting in 1988 between Julian Morris and Andrew Dainis 
in Washington, DC that launched the AMASS software suite and the C3D file format 
into the commercial world.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Virtually all of the updates and revisions to this 
documentation have been written as a result of having to explain to C3D users 
why certain files cannot be read correctly, or being asked to explain the 
function of certain parts of the format.  This user guide has never been 
the source of any significant changes to the C3D file format although it 
describes many minor changes made by various motion capture companies to the 
format and contents of the files that they create.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">When the C3D file format was first created and became 
widely used, everyone creating C3D files discussed the features and internal 
options in public and, in the early days, many changes were proposed to add or 
extend features.  Some changes were implemented after widespread 
discussions (e.g. floating point support, unsigned <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103563" href="gloss_integer.htm">integer</a> frame counts) while others were discarded 
(event range storage) after the discussions with everyone revealed potential 
data access problems that the authors had not considered.  The result is 
that the documented C3D is an exceptionally stable file format that has remained 
universally accessible.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I am happy to acknowledge the assistance and encouragement 
of many people in compiling the information within this user guide.  While, 
for the most part I have taken their advice, the structure and presentation of 
the information within this document has been my own.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Please let me know if you find any errors, or if you think 
that I have failed to explain any aspects of the C3D format.  I will update 
the documentation to correct any reported errors and expand explanations if 
necessary.  Any questions about the C3D format should be sent to <a href="mailto:info@c3d.org"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Tahoma&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">info@c3d.org</span></a> – if you are 
having problems with a specific C3D file then including a copy of the file with 
your questions will usually help.</p>
