<h2>Revision History</h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The revision history is in reverse chronological order and 
documents major changes to the documentation, providing descriptions of C3D 
format interpretations that have evolved over time.  The last major change 
to the C3D format occurred in 1989, prior to the creation of this documentation, 
when support for a 32-bit <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103518" href="gloss_floatingpoint1.htm">floating-point</a> data storage 
format was added to the C3D format.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As a result this revision history attempts to describe all 
significant documentation changes and interpretations.  It does not record 
minor edits that may change the date on the first page, but do not significantly 
affect the C3D format description.</p><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="october62021.htm" id="october62021.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">October 6, 2021</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As a result of a few discussions with users attempting to 
modify the file structure (and some users trying to access it) this revision 
clarifies many aspects of the file format.  Several old discussions of 
potential extensions have been removed because most of the original ADTECH file 
options are not part of the C3D file environment and may result in the creation 
of data stored in a way that existing C3D users are unable to access.  The 
data <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103519" href="gloss_section.htm">section</a> format definitions and file structure 
descriptions exist to explain the C3D environment that was created to ensure 
that the C3D file contents are always easily accessible.</p><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="may312020.htm" id="may312020.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">May 31, 2020</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This revision expands the C3D specification description and 
the explanations of the <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">ANALOG</span></span> and <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">FORCE_PLATFORM</span></span> group <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103520" href="gloss_parameters.htm">parameters</a>.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The minimal descriptions of TYPE-5, TYPE-6, TYPE-7, 
TYPE-11, TYPE-12, and TYPE-21 force plates have been removed – these force plate 
types were created by C-Motion for internal calculations but were not documented 
in detail and are rarely seen in C3D files.  All C3D users can define 
unique force plate types to handle specific plate configurations, but any new 
force plate type will need to be verified and fully documentated before it can 
be added to the C3D format description.</p><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="february102020.htm" id="february102020.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">February 10, 2020</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Many areas discussing the internal details affecting the 
C3D format implementation have been moved to an appendix to avoid making 
individual parameter descriptions complex.  The appendix describes how to 
implement the C3D specification in areas that have been interpreted differently 
as the use of the C3D format has evolved over time.  The documentation 
redistribution terms have been simplified, some chapters have been reorganized 
to make the CMH help edition easier to navigate, and a few typos describing the 
signed number ranges have been corrected with explanations of the signed vs 
unsigned formats added.</p><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="november102019.htm" id="november102019.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">November 10, 2019</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The description of the C3D frame count has been reorganized 
and expanded to explain that storing the <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">POINT:FRAMES</span></span> count as either an <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103524" href="gloss_integer.htm">integer</a> or <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103521" href="gloss_floatingpoint1.htm">floating-point</a> value is fully supported by 
the C3D format which simplifies the current complex situation where the C3D 
frame count is determine by reading multiple <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103522" href="gloss_parameters.htm">parameters</a>.  The individual descriptions of 
the <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">POINT:LONG_FRAMES</span></span> parameter and the <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt"><a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103527" href="gloss_trial.htm"><span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">TRIAL</span></span></a>:ACTUAL_START_FIELD 
</span></span>and<span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt"> 
TRIAL:ACTUAL_END_FIELD</span></span> parameters have updated to document the how 
the frame count of a C3D file should be determined when these parameters are 
present.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The description of the C3D file header has been corrected 
to explain that words 4 and 5 in the C3D header <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103525" href="gloss_section.htm">section</a> record the frame numbers of the original 
video data that that was used to generate the C3D file.  Therefore these 
header values are not the actual C3D file frame numbers and should be 
ignored.  However many applications incorrectly treat the header words as 
storing the C3D file frame range numbers due to errors in earlier documentation 
releases so they may need to be maintained until modern C3D applications are 
updated to ignore the header frame numbers.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A detailed explanation of the handling of more than 255 
point and analog channels has been added to clarify that the additional 
parameters must be synchronized with each other and that when <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">LABELS2</span></span> exists, 
<span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">LABELS</span></span> must 
always contain 255 values.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Numerous minor edits to various descriptions throughout the 
text to improve the documentation level by clarifying the internal details of 
parameters and groups.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The parameter format description has been updated to 
clarify that the parameter name can be no longer than 127, 7-bit <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103526" href="gloss_ascii.htm">ASCII</a> <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103523" href="gloss_characters.htm">characters</a>; the parameter name 
length must be stored as a signed byte, not an unsigned value, to preserve the 
locked, or unlocked, status of the parameter.</p><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="october152019.htm" id="october152019.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">October 15, 2019</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The most significant change has been to describe the 
optional use of <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103533" href="gloss_utf8.htm">UTF-8</a> encoding for user entered character data.  
Standard 7-bit <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103534" href="gloss_ascii.htm">ASCII</a> values are required for all internal group and 
parameter names in the C3D file to maintain application compatibility.  
UTF-8 encoding is completely compatible with the original C3D format description 
at a byte level, and will add support for all non-ASCII standard languages and 
character sets.  This will be a considerable improvement in terms of user 
friendliness but will require that all applications that support C3D files are 
upgraded to display user entered UTF-8 encoded <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103530" href="gloss_characters.htm">characters</a> correctly in future.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The descriptions of the C3D header first frame, last frame 
range numbers have been corrected in multiple places throughout the 
documentation.  The first and last frame numbers stored in the C3D header 
only document the frame numbers of the <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103531" href="gloss_rawdata.htm">raw data</a> that was used to create the C3D 
file.  They are not C3D file frame numbers, and do not affect the times 
used to record events or the calculation of the C3D file size.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The support of additional analog channels, by extending the 
definitions of the <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">ANALOG:LABELS</span></span> and <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">ANALOG:DESCRIPTIONS</span></span> <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103529" href="gloss_parameters.htm">parameters</a>, has been documented.  This has 
always been theoretically possible but now that IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) 
devices are appearing in motion capture data, the analog channel recording 
resource needs have increased.  Note that recording IMU data together with 
analog sources and motion capture information may present a synchronization 
challenge for the hardware manufacturers.  The C3D format supports perfect 
synchronization but the actual validity of the recorded data is determined by 
the data collection environment that collects and writes the samples to the C3D 
file.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This release expands the explanations of the functions of 
various parts of the C3D format to attempt to bring the documentation up to 
current usage standards, document the evolution of the format, and provide 
information to help new users and programmers troubleshoot common issues when 
they create and read C3D files.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Additional documentation has been added to try to explain 
the reasoning behind various groups and parameters as a result of discovering 
many errors over the years in different interpretations of the C3D format. 
Numerous descriptions of the signed vs unsigned <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103532" href="gloss_integer.htm">integer</a> interpretations have been removed as they 
are no longer significant.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The descriptions of many application specific parameters in 
previous versions of the documentation have been removed as they may be out of 
date.  Please contact your application vendor for the most accurate details 
of the groups and parameters that their applications are creating.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Various chapters that discuss analog data collection and 
storage have been updated to describe many common problems that are created when 
<a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103528" href="gloss_floatingpoint1.htm">floating-point</a> data becomes the default 
storage mechanism and to provide a more detailed explanation of the various data 
storage formats.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The C3D format documentation is now available both as a 
printable PDF file and also the CHM (Compiled HTML, c3dformat.chm) format for 
distribution with applications, as well as on-line at the C3D web site. The 
distribution terms have been updated to request that any changes made to the 
documentation by third parties are communicated by email to <a href="mailto:info@c3d.org"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Tahoma&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">info@c3d.org</span></a> to keep the 
format details up to date.</p><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="may2520192.htm" id="may2520192.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">May 25, 2019</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The source documents for this documentation have been 
upgraded to Doc-To-Help 2009 using the Office Open XML standard to support the 
creation of a PDF user guide, a new HTML web-site, and CHM complied help format 
files.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Many changes throughout the documentation have been made to 
fix spelling and grammatical errors as well as the presentation format.  
The printed format, with space for handwritten notes on the left side of each 
page, has been preserved.</p><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="january320192.htm" id="january320192.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">January 3, 2019</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The use of unsigned integers in <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103536" href="gloss_parameters.htm">parameters</a> and indexes was first described in 
2004.  At that time documentation added to this user guide describing 
unsigned <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103537" href="gloss_integer.htm">integer</a> usage as an option.  This user guide 
now describes the use of unsigned integers as the standard and documents the 
potential issues for older applications.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">References to the original ADTECH PRM application have been 
removed as this was a command line application that, in a current MSDOS or 
Windows environment, only runs on 16-bit systems.  PRM remains available 
for download from the C3D web site and includes source code to read <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103535" href="gloss_decintelandsgimips1.htm">DEC, Intel, and SGI/MIPS</a> formats.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">References to the new Label Range proposal for event 
storage have been removed as this C3D event storage mechanism has never been 
implemented.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Documentation has been added to describe the issues created 
in several areas of the C3D format that often generate compatibility and data 
reliability issues.</p><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="may2920102.htm" id="may2920102.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">May 29, 2010</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Added descriptions of the <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">POINT:LONG_FRAMES</span></span> parameter and <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt"><a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103539" href="gloss_trial.htm"><span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">TRIAL</span></span></a></span></span> <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103538" href="gloss_parameters.htm">parameters</a> that have been added to support C3D 
files with more than 65535 frames.  Corrected the description of the camera 
mask storage to indicate that bit 8 of the camera mask byte stores the point 
mask sign value.</p><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="november2020082.htm" id="november2020082.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">November 20, 2008</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Corrected the illustration of “A simple parameter record 
stored as a <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103540" href="gloss_floatingpoint1.htm">floating-point</a> value” to use the correct 
parameter ID and added more detailed descriptions of the format of <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103541" href="gloss_parameters.htm">parameters</a> that contain <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103542" href="gloss_arrays.htm">arrays</a> for the benefit of C and C++ programmers who 
are not familiar with FORTRAN data structures.  This added documentation 
expands both the parameter description of C3D arrays and extends the <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">CAL_MATRIX</span></span> 
explanation to demonstrate the structure of arrays within C3D files.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The explanation of the <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">FORCE_PLATFORM:ORIGIN</span></span> parameter has been 
updated to discuss a change in the AMTI documentation of the force platform 
origin for <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">TYPE-2</span></span> force plates.</p><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="february1920082.htm" id="february1920082.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">February 19, 2008</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The documentation has been updated add information about 
the Vicon Motion Systems Ltd use of the <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">TYPE-2</span></span> force plate definition to store 
scaled force and moment information instead of raw analog signals.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">An error in the user guide that stated that the <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">ANALOG:USED</span></span> 
parameter was stored in the C3D header and been corrected. The <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">ANALOG:USED</span></span> value 
is not stored in the C3D header but can be calculated from two values that are 
stored in the header.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The user guide has been updated to add additional 
information to describe the sampling rate restrictions for both <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103543" href="gloss_3dpoint.htm">3D point</a> and analog data that are implicit in the 
C3D format but had not been explained in detail by the documentation. Added some 
notes on analog scaling values pointing out that using incorrect scale values 
can cause the data to be corrupted. This release provides some additional 
information on force platform types that have been described by C-Motion. These 
force plate descriptions are currently incomplete.</p><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="january2520062.htm" id="january2520062.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">January 25, 2006</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The description of the storage of analog data <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103544" href="gloss_parameters.htm">parameters</a> in the C3D file header has been 
re-written and the description of analog data storage has been expanded. An 
example has been added to demonstrate how the various parameters that describe 
the analog data are calculated. The original descriptions contained a couple of 
errors and were hard to understand.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This release restores a chapter on additional C3D 
parameters that provides information on parameters and groups that have been 
introduced to the C3D file format by various software applications or motion 
capture manufacturers. These groups are becoming common in C3D files, notably 
the <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">MANUFACTURER</span></span> and <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">EVENT</span></span> groups, 
together with other groups such as the <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">SEG</span></span> and <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt"><a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103545" href="gloss_trial.htm"><span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">TRIAL</span></span></a></span></span> groups that provide 
additional information, but are not required by the original C3D format 
description. The <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">EVENT</span></span> and <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">EVENT_CONTEXT</span></span> groups are particularly 
interesting as they provide a flexible method of storing event and other time 
specific data within the existing C3D format using parameters.</p><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="july2020052.htm" id="july2020052.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">July 20, 2005</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Additional explanations have been added and expanded that 
document the C3D file header word that describes the number of analog samples in 
a <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103546" href="gloss_3dframe.htm">3D frame</a>.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The definition of the <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">FORCE_PLATFORM:ZERO</span></span> parameter has been 
updated to make it clear that only a value of 0,0 indicates that no baseline 
offset correction is to be applied to the force platform data.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Minor grammatical changes to reserve the word “<a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103547" href="gloss_section.htm">section</a>” for use with parts of the C3D file 
description and avoid confusion with various chapters of the user guide and 
documentation.</p><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="july620042.htm" id="july620042.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">July 6, 2004</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Added descriptions of the <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">ANALOG:FORMAT</span></span> and <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">ANALOG:BITS</span></span> <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103548" href="gloss_parameters.htm">parameters</a> that have been added to help software 
applications to read C3D files that contain unsigned 16-bit <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103549" href="gloss_integer.htm">integer</a> data. These descriptions, and an additional 
discussion at the start of the chapter, should be read carefully by anyone 
attempting to read or write 16-bit analog data values in C3D files.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The possibility of encountering unsigned 16-bit integers 
within the analog data storage has led to substantial alteration of the 
descriptions of most of the parameters controlling analog data. In particular, 
the chapter describing the <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">ANALOG:OFFSET</span></span> parameter has had to be 
completely rewritten to accommodate the possibility of interpreting the 
parameter as either a signed or unsigned integer value depending on the format 
used to store analog data values. A brief discussion has been added at the end 
of the <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">ANALOG:OFFSET</span></span> discussion that describes 
methods of “zeroing” analog data to remove measurement offsets. While this 
document takes no position as to the merits of any of the data zeroing methods 
described, users are strongly encouraged to write the data as signed integers 
when storing analog data values.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The description of the <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">ORIGIN(3)</span></span> parameter for <span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">TYPE-3</span></span> force 
plates has been changed to make it clear that this value is normally 
negative.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Various typographic errors have been either fixed (or moved 
to new areas of the document). Please let us know if (when) you find any errors 
or vague descriptions that could be improved. Please feel free to write

<p class="MsoBodyText">To keep the bankers, lawyers and other folk happy, a formal 
redistribution clause setting out the terms and conditions for the 
redistribution of this document by third parties has been added to the user 
guide. This simply sets out the previous “freely available to all” policy in 
more formal terms.</p><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="february1620032.htm" id="february1620032.htm"></a>

<p class="MsoBodyText">The chapter describing analog scaling has been expanded to 
include a worked example showing the calculation of the scale factor for a 
typical load cell. The C3D file basics and final chapter on the future of the

<p class="MsoBodyText">Andrew Dainis has contributed a foreword to the user guide. 
This version of the user guide contains additional information about the concept 
of Parameter Files and points out that they are not an essential part of the C3D 
specification. Additional information has been added to the description of the 
<span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">CAL_MATRIX</span></span> 
parameter, which now explicitly states that it uses the Calibration matrix while 
<span class="ParameterChar"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">TYPE-2</span></span> 
plates use the Sensitivity matrix.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The C3D format definition introduces the concept of signed 
and unsigned C3D files to accommodate the issues raised by the use of unsigned 
integers and <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103553" href="gloss_bytes.htm">bytes</a> within the parameter <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103552" href="gloss_section.htm">section</a> of C3D files. This has involved a major 
re-work to explicitly state the <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103551" href="gloss_integer.htm">integer</a> and byte types (signed vs. 
unsigned) throughout the user guide. The chapters describing non-essential C3D 
<a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103550" href="gloss_parameters.htm">parameters</a> and many manufacturer specific 
parameters have been removed from this release. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In addition to the printed user guide and Adobe PDF 
document, this release is available in an on-line HTML formatted help link on 
the C3D web site and may be viewed live.  The web site help page will now 
be updated regularly.</p><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="april720022.htm" id="april720022.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">April 7, 2002</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The documentation was revised with substantial editorial 
changes throughout to improve readability i.e., the replacement of the word <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103556" href="gloss_real.htm">REAL</a> with the more common term “<a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103555" href="gloss_floatingpoint1.htm">floating-point</a>”. The description of the 
structure of parameter files has changed substantially and several pages have 
been added to describe the calculation of analog scale factors, particularly 
with reference to force platforms. The user guide now includes examples of the 
calculations for each type of force plate. A short description of the history of 
the C3D format has been added to the introduction.</p><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="october2820012.htm" id="october2820012.htm"></a>

<p class="MsoBodyText">The first version of this user guide was created as a 
result of user requests during the C3D User Group discussions sponsored by 
Motion Lab Systems Inc., in March 2001 at the 6<sup>th</sup> Annual Gait and 
Clinical Motion Analysis Society meeting in Sacramento, California. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This first version was released in print, and as a 
publically accessible Adobe PDF document on the C3D web site in November 2001, 
based on an explanation of the original <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103558" href="gloss_ascii.htm">ASCII</a> text document created by Andrew Dainis in 1987 
that described the C3D format as a convenient and efficient means for storing 3D 
coordinate and analog data, with all associated <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103557" href="gloss_parameters.htm">parameters</a>, for a single measurement <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103559" href="gloss_trial.htm">trial</a> while allowing the all users to easily examine, 
and if necessary modify, any parameter contained in the 
file.</p></div></div></body></html>
