<h3>A Brief History</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt">Before the C3D format was created, 
each motion capture system vendor created data files in custom formats that 
contained the data collected.  Systems created a unique collection of data 
files that their users had to figure out how to process.  Each motion 
capture manufacturer understood how their systems worked but had virtually no 
experience of the clinical and research data environments in which <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103574" href="thesystemswereused.htm">the systems were used</a>.  This made life 
difficult for individual laboratories and very hard for researchers in multiple 
data collection environments to share their data with researchers using 
different systems while working on the same research area, grant, or 
project.  Originally the only way to share and compare data clinically was 
to print out the results on paper.  The C3D format was created in the 
National Institute of Health in Bethesda, Maryland under the direction of Steven 
Stanhope, to rectify this situation by creating a file format that put the 
preservation, compatibility, and integrity of every data collection, with the 
ability to share and compare data, at the top of the end-users concerns.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The precursor to the C3D file format was AMASS, a binary 
file containing a header <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103578" href="gloss_section.htm">section</a>, plus interleaved 3D 
coordinate and analog data that was first used by the SELSPOT 3D motion analysis 
system in the early 1980s.  An important goal in the design of AMASS was to 
have a format environment that met all needs for both parameter input/exchange 
and data storage.  This was achieved by adding a standard, readily 
accessible, parameter section to all files, which documents the individual 
parameter values and describes all of the data included in the file resulting in 
a universal file structure that supports a wide range of file formats.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">By the late 1980’s, the AMASS software, written in FORTRAN, 
had evolved to support camera lens distortion correction and calibration, with 
automated data reduction, and automatic marker tracking.  The AMASS 
software suite ran on the RSX11-M and VAX/VMS based systems manufactured by 
Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and used C3D as its output data 
format.  AMASS was the first software application to offer completely 
automatic 3D trajectory calculations for complex moving targets while 
compensating for camera lens distortion.  This was a significant 
improvement when compared to commercial photogrammetry software available at 
that time which required that the operator identify the individual 2D 
trajectories manually and then stored the 3D trajectories in one file format, 
the analog data in another file format, and information defining the data 
collection environment in additional files, each with their own unique 
format.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In 1988 Oxford Metrics Ltd., obtained distribution rights 
for the AMASS software from ADTECH (a company created by Andrew Dainis) after 
observing the ability of the AMASS software at the National Institutes of Health 
to automatically track and identify 3D trajectories from data collected with an 
early Oxford Metrics motion capture system while needing virtually no operator 
involvement.  The AMASS software used a single file format definition to 
store the data and <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103575" href="gloss_parameters.htm">parameters</a> that it generated, in 
one uniform binary file format.  This was used by each of the AMASS 
applications, each storing its data in a separate file as the data collection 
environment was described, data collected, processed, and finally combined into 
a single file that stored the <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103576" href="gloss_3dpoint.htm">3D point</a> co-ordinates and analog 
measurements, together with all the information (parameters) needed to access 
and process the contents of the file – this was the original C3D file 
format.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In the early days, virtually all motion capture software 
was written in a computer specific assembler language.  All of the AMASS 
applications were written in FORTRAN, a factor that had some influence on the 
internal C3D structures, which were first documented so that clinical analysis 
and research applications, written in Oregon Software Pascal-2, could access the 
files in DEC and MSDOS environments.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Initially, Oxford Metrics Ltd., (Oxford, England) offered 
the AMASS software as an option for its RSX-11M based hardware systems in the 
USA which, prior to the introduction of the C3D format, had produced a handful 
of different files, each with a unique format, for each <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103579" href="gloss_trial.htm">trial</a> of data.  A few AMASS systems were 
installed with the Vicon RSX-11M systems before the introduction of the Vicon 
VAX/VMS based systems which supported AMASS as the automated trajectory 
reconstruction application and C3D as the default data output format.  The 
Vicon-VX VAX/VMS software package integrated the AMASS software within a DCL 
based menu system and was considerably more successful than its command-line 
driven RSX-11M based predecessors, eventually selling many hundreds of systems 
worldwide.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The first substantial “freeware” application supporting the 
C3D file format emerged in 1991 with the release of ANZ,/Telios/Show3D, a motion 
data analysis package written by Dwight Meglan, at Ohio State University, as 
part of his doctoral thesis.  Command line driven, and running under 
MS-DOS, this package offered substantial modeling and kinematic features 
together with output graphs and animations.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The introduction in 1992 of the Vicon Clinical Manager 
application (VCM), running on Microsoft Windows 3 and, performing clinical gait 
analysis calculations derived from the Helen Hayes Hospital Software, generated 
considerable interest in the C3D format.  The graphical application enabled 
users to generate clinical gait analysis graphs from motion capture data and its 
popularity placed the C3D file format in the position that it occupies today as 
the standard format for biomechanical <a onclick="return d2hpopup(event, this.href)" id="popup_103577" href="gloss_3ddata.htm">3D data</a>.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Once VCM dominated the clinical gait analysis software 
market, Oxford Metrics released a Microsoft Windows based data collection and 
photogrammetry application to replace AMASS while maintaining the C3D file 
format.  As a result ADTECH updated AMASS to process raw video data files 
from multiple other motion capture system vendors using both Intel and Silicon 
Graphics hardware.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This period also saw the release of MOVE3D, a sophisticated 
3D biomechanics analysis program developed by Tom Kepple at NIH, which further 
expanded the use of C3D files and led to the formation of C-Motion and the 
Visual3D suite.  The availability of both MOVE3D for biomechanics 
researchers, and Vicon Clinical Manager for the clinical gait analysis market, 
were major factors in the creation of a significant user base for the C3D file 
format.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The first commercial C3D application was the C3Deditor 
(Motion Lab Systems, 1997), which gave users the ability to easily assess, edit, 
and repair all C3D files in the graphical Windows environment, regardless of the 
original data collection environment.  Prior to the C3Deditor the only 
tools available for C3D development were a limited set of MS-DOS applications 
(PRM etc.) written in FORTRAN and released with the AMASS software - these, 
together with the C3Deditor, became the standards against which all C3D 
applications were evaluated.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The next widely used application was the C3Dserver, a free 
application that was written by Motion Lab Systems to make C3D files available 
for all users in the Windows environment so that they could access the C3D data 
that their motion capture systems were creating.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As a result of the adoption and support by many different 
vendors, the C3D format has become the standard in virtually all clinical gait 
and biomechanics laboratories, as well as many other areas such as the animation 
and entertainment industries where it is supported by almost all leading 
animation packages and many user written applications.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In 2012 C3D Labs, a Russian CAD developer released a CAD 
format that used the .C3D filetype but the format is completely unrelated to the 
ADTECH C3D format, resulting in files that are unreadable in the 3D biomechanics 
and motion capture environments.</p></div></div></body></html>
