title: EVENT_CONTEXT:COLOURS
---

Note the British English spelling of this item in contrast to the US English spellings used everywhere in the C3D format description.  It is a (3,EVENT_CONTEXT:USED) array of unsigned integers that store the colors used by each event type as (R,G,B) triplets with each value in the range 0 to 255.  Potentially this allows an application to highlight particular events in the C3D file with specific colors.
