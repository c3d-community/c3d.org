title: EVENT:ICON_IDS
---

An array of (EVENT:USED) signed integers that allow an application to identify the icons associated with each event as defined in the EVENT:DESCRIPTIONS parameters when the data is displayed by an application.  So an ICON_ID can be thought of as displaying an event type that may be specific to the application presenting the data to the user.  Since the values of this parameter have never been specified, applications must provide the actual icon representation themselves.
