title: EVENT:DESCRIPTIONS
---

This is an array of user defined strings – typically sized as (EVENT:USED,32) – that stores a description for each event.  This can be a long event definition (for example, “The moment any part of the foot first contacts the floor during a gait cycle”) or a simple descriptive string e.g.  Heel Contact, Cyswllt sawdl, Kontakt pięty, etc.
