title: EVENT:SUBJECTS
---

An array of (EVENT:USED) user define strings that serves to identify subject names associated with individual events.  This parameter supports situations where they may be several different subjects recorded at the same time.  Empty strings apply to the whole trial so, if present, this parameter will usually be empty if there was only a single subject recorded in the trial.
