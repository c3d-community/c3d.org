title: TYPE-3
---

The force platform has eight analog outputs, which are combinations of the X, Y, and Z forces measured at each of the corners of the force platform, an arrangement typical of Kistler force plates.

It is recommended that each analog channel signal is identified with a unique ANALOG:LABEL and ANALOG:DESCRIPTION to store information in each C3D file that documents the file contents. Typical Kistler specific ANALOG:LABEL and ANALOG:DESCRIPTIONS are shown below.  When multiple force plates are used, identify each plate with a number to ensure that each ANALOG:LABEL is unique.  Correctly identifying each force plate channel takes very little effort when compared to the amount of time that can be spent attempting to discover force plate configuration and scaling issues in data.
