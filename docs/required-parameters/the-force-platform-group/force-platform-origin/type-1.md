title: TYPE-1
---

For a TYPE-1 force platform only the third component is used, while any values stored in ORIGIN(1,) and ORIGIN(2,) are ignored.  ORIGIN(3,) must contain the displacement from the force plate coordinate system origin to the working surface of the force platform.  Normally the force plate coordinate system origin is below the surface of the platform and the coordinate system z-axis is directed downwards, so that the sign of the distance entered in ORIGIN(3,) will be negative.
