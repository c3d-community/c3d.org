title: TYPE-4
---

A TYPE-4 force platform stores the FORCE_PLATFORM:ORIGIN parameter in exactly the same way as a Type-2 force platform.  The ORIGIN parameter must hold the components of the vector pointing from the origin of the FP coordinate system to the point at the geometric center of the working surface of the force platform.  This vector is always expressed in the force platform coordinate system.
