title: ANALOG:UNITS
---

The ANALOG:UNITS parameter is an array of character data values (normally each value is 4 characters in length).  This parameter stores the analog measurement units for each channel (e.g.  V, N, Nm).  The units should describe the quantities after the scaling factors are applied â€“ as a result, there should always be one ANALOG:UNITS entry for a total of ANALOG:USED channels.

Note that changing the ANALOG:UNITS parameter does not automatically affect the calculated analog values, as it is not used in the analog scaling calculations.  You must change the ANALOG:SCALE parameter to re-scale the analog data.
