title: SEG:ACC_FACTOR
---

A single floating-point value that sets the maximum average acceleration (in terms of POINT:UNITS seconds, per second) over five successive samples for photogrammetry software to start a new segment.  This generally has a nominal value for gait analysis of 50mm/sec/sec but this may be varied for other trajectory sources.
