title: The SUBJECTS Group
---

The SUBJECTS group is normally an application specific group that may contain parameters that allow applications processing the 3D points to associate specific 3D points with multiple individuals with the data collection trial, recording the subject details and the names of specific marker sets and analysis details used.  Users must contact the manufacturer of the application that creates this group to obtain details and descriptions of the function of these parameters.

It should not be confused with the SUBJECT group found in many early clinical C3D files that recorded details specific to each trial and session, such as gender, name, date of birth, weight etc.

When editing or processing any C3D file that contains a SUBJECTS group, it is recommended that the parameters in the group are preserved unchanged.
