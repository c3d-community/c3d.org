title: The POINT Group
---

Although initially conceived as a group that provided information about the 3D data stored in the file, the POINT group also contains a number of parameters that may control the display and presentation of the data to the user.  Various manufacturers have added parameters to this group that allow applications to store processed data within the 3D data section so that C3D files may now contain the results of modeling calculations in addition to marker positional information.
