As a result the C3D data synchronization was originally under the control of the environment that creates the C3D file.  However, analog signals are often filtered before being sampled by the ADC which can result in minor signal latency issues, unique to each data source.  For example, when analog force plate data is low-pass filtered at 10.5Hz, the data may be delayed by 25ms.  As a result when the force data is compared with foot-switch data recorded with a latency of only 2ms, the foot-switch data appears to report a foot strike before the force plate records the heel strike, because the force data has been filtered resulting in a delay."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Typical data collection system \u201ccalibrations\u201d only record the 3D measurement accuracy, not the analog data collection or data synchronization accuracy."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,o.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},8453:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{R:()=>i,x:()=>s});var n=a(6540);const o={},r=n.createContext(o);function i(e){const t=n.useContext(r);return n.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}},[t,e])}function s(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(o):e.components||o:i(e.components),n.createElement(r.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
