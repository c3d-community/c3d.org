In recent years C3D files with more than 65535 frames have been appearing and manufacturers have invented various methods of storing the frame count that may not be understood by all applications.

The Mokka graphical interface makes C3D data visualization convenient but it does not provide a detailed breakdown of the C3D file contents and, as a user written application, it is unsupported and as a result it may report \u201cerrors\u201d due to some misunderstandings about the details of the C3D file format, so any error messages displayed by Mokka may be a result of internal Mokka issues.  For example when a C3D file does not contain any force plate data and the FORCE_PLATFORM",":USED"," parameter has been set 0 (conforming to the C3D format) Mokka may report that the force plate location parameters are missing even though the C3D file parameters have documented that there are no force plates.  So the \u201cerror\u201d that Mokka reports may be an internal coding error, not an actual C3D file error in some cases.
