This lack of understanding resulted in some attempts to put \u201cround pegs into square holes\u201d, and generated a legacy of C3D files and applications that digressed from the original format and intention.  Many of these files and their applications are still around today and cause considerable problems for programmers who wish to handle every C3D file.
