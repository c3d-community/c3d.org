Certain items received from Motion Lab Systems were not committed, as follows:

    C3D-related software created by Motion Lab Systems
    and others.
  - Contents of the `data` directory, which contained all C3D example files totalling 258.5 MB.
  - Original source to the C3D user guide which had been created for use with proprietary documentation software Doc-to-Help.  The resulting guide is present though, in `docs\C3D_User_Guide.pdf`, `docs\C3D_User_Guide.chm` and `HTML`.
